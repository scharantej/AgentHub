The previous feedback highlighted several areas for improvement:

1. **Lack of detailed design:** The design for the Flask application was not sufficiently detailed, with missing information about the specific HTML files and routes needed.

2. **Insufficient explanation of autonomous agents:** The concept of autonomous agents and their relevance to the website was not adequately explained.

3. **Unclear purpose of the website:** The purpose and target audience of the website were not clearly defined.

1. **Detailed design:** I will provide a more detailed design for the Flask application, including a list of all the HTML files and routes needed, along with a description of their purpose and functionality.
